# Augmented Reality Enso Sculptures

## Alessandro Ravagnan & Devin Hinzo

### About the Project

This project is a collaboration between life partners and is being featured at the DUO Show at Worthington Yards in Downtown Cleveland, Ohio. The show opens Saturday, October 10, 2020 and runs through Saturday, October 31, 2020.

This piece is a digital rendering of physical works by Ravagnan in which these pieces, called ENSOs, represent 2D membranes of a universe. The physical pieces are made from screen-printed tissue paper which is collaged into various circles and knots, inspired by principles of Buddhism, Knot Theory, Metaphysics, and other Spiritual Practices. To model them in 3D, Ravagnan scans the physical works and then models and animate them in Blender, an open-source 3D graphics program.

### How to View

1. At Worthington Yards, scan the QR Code linking to the Github Page for arEnsos. 
2. Accept the permissions from the app to use your camera. THIS IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO VIEW THE PIECES! This app is secure and is ONLY used for viewing art.
3. Wait a few moments for the model to render. If you do not see anything after 15 seconds, refresh the page.
4. If the model is out of view of the user, refresh the page.

### Technology Used

This project uses the HTML Framework A-Frame for easily creating VR/AR/XR web experiences, and AR.js, a JavaScript library for creating and deploying AR projects 100% via the web. These two projects are professionally maintained and aim to make XR accessible for both users and developers. Check them out!

* [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) - Web Framework for VR/AR/XR Experiences
* [AR.js](https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/) - Lightweight JS Library for Augmented Reality 

### Stages of the project

Final AR on display at the gallery. You can see the original, 2D, physical works to the left.

This is an early protoype. It was difficult find the right file size/type to show the color in the final version. The early protypes were black.

### Known Issues

At deployment, known issues include jittery 3D models. This is due to the nature of geotagged work.
